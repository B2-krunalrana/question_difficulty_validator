# AI-Powered Question Difficulty Validator  

## Description  
This script uses Python, SQL, and AI to validate and assign difficulty levels to questions. It combines manual inputs, student performance data, and AI predictions to ensure accurate difficulty assessment.  

## Features  
- Assign difficulty levels manually.  
- Calculate difficulty based on student performance metrics (e.g., average scores).  
- Use AI models to validate and refine difficulty levels.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**: Core scripting and AI model implementation.  
- **SQL**: Database interaction and querying.  
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning for AI validation.  

## How It Works  
1. **Manual Input**: Difficulty levels are manually assigned by educators.  
2. **Performance-Based Calculation**: Difficulty is derived from student performance data (e.g., scores, response time).  
3. **AI Validation**: AI models analyze question features and validate difficulty levels.  

## Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
